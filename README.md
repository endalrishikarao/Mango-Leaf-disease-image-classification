Mango-Leaf-Image-Classification

**About the project**: The objective of this project is to identify the disease of the leaves ,Here in this dataset there are total 8 classifiers that is diseases specified as the labels in the datset with different images.Here we have to do mango leaf image classification

**Installation guidelines**: Since the project is constructed over Colab, no special installations are needed. However, some libraries are necessary for this undertaking and must be included. The majority of them are fundamental tools like "numpy" and "pandas," which are essential components of any project involving machine learning.

**Running the project:**
1. Log in to Google Colab with your Google account by opening the website in a computer browser.
2. Download the code to your colab from the source. You must make a copy of this view-only notebook in your local drive so that you can modify it.
3. Click "Runtime" in the top menu to choose a runtime type, then select "GPU" to execute more quickly.
4. Download the dataset and submit it to the drive using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions.
5. Mount the drive so you can access the information from there.
6. The remaining directions ask you to run each code fragment and collect the results.
**
Features of the project**: This project focuses on comparing the accuracy of different image classifiers like Convolution nueral network,K nearest neighbor and Naive bayes classifier
**Additional Details**: This involves a sizable dataset with around 4000 pictures. Therefore, it is advised that one employs fast runtime hardware and large RAM when computing.
